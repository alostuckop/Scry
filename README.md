
# Scry
## Objective
Scry's purpose is to make playing D&D more fun by removing boring tasks from
the player and allowing them to focus on what matters.

## D&D Source Material
Scry is not a database of source material. While Scry can support source
material, Scry will not provide it. Users are expected to provide their own 
data via official methods such as purchasing the D&D 5e source books.
